## FAQs
### I haven't used scripts before on AsusWRT-Merlin
If this is the first time you are using scripts, don't panic! In your router's WebUI, go to the Administration area of the left menu, and then the System tab. Set Enable JFFS custom scripts and configs to Yes.

Further reading about scripts is available here: [AsusWRT-Merlin User-scripts](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/User-scripts)
